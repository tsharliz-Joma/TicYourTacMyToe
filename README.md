# Tic Tac Toe
### by yours truley



## Discription

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe /Naughts and crosses/Dungeons and Dragons/Snakes and Ladders game 
Created Using Html, Css and Js, I used boostrap for most of the css and Jquery
X is the first player and is protayed as Sassy the sasquatch 
O is second player and displayed as Pepe the frog 

Whoever wins a match is displayed in a super saiyen version of their character
A draw is displayed in a plain gray text 

There is a score board on eithe rside of the squares keeping count of who has won the most matches

In had to play around abit with the positioning of where the end result was displayed which was a touch annoying it did not end up 
how i wanted it to so i had to make it a stand centered display.
Also with the score-board i could not get the test of the score-board to wrap so if you win a certain number of times the text flows off the screen

## Code 

A commonly used variable in the browser is called `document`. See also: `window` which also crops up a lot. jQuery sues teh `$` variable


```Javascript
const hey = funtion(){
    console.log('Hello World')
}
```
