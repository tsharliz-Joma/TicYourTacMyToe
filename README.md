### by yours truley



## Discription

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe /Naughts and crosses/Dungeons and Dragons/Snakes and Ladders game 
Created Using Html, Css and Js, I used boostrap for most of the css and Jquery
X is the first player and is protayed as Sassy the sasquatch 
O is second player and displayed as Pepe the frog 

Whoever wins a match is displayed in a super saiyen version of their character
A draw is displayed in a plain gray text 

There is a score board on eithe rside of the squares keeping count of who has won the most matches

In had to play around abit with the positioning of where the end result was displayed which was a touch annoying it did not end up 
how i wanted it to so i had to make it a stand centered display.
I struggled getting an AI to play against although i believe i was close and will be able to in the verson 2.0

I used bootstrap just because it was the first thing that came to my head when i thought buttons to press, i did realise it is a touch annoying and it influenced my logic a little but we learn

## How To.

Just go to this [.....]() which at this point i cant figure out why it wont work but i just want to finish this.

There is no installation needed...I think but have fun <d-_-b>.
